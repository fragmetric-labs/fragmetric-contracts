### ⚠️ CAVEAT
When directly using embedded `idl.json` or generated `@solana/kit` compatible codes for client-side transaction encoding or account resolution, make sure to configure the **correct program address** for each integration.

Program addresses may differ between devnet and mainnet deployments.  Always verify and set the appropriate address based on the current network environment.

> Check the official Fragmetric documentation to confirm valid program addresses.
